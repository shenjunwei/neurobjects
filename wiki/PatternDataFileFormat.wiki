#summary Describes the Weka relation file format for spike rate patterns

= Spike rate patterns file format specification =


== Naming ==

A spike rate pattern file must have a *.arff* extension.


== Structure ==

The Weka relation files for spike rate patterns, as generated by
`PatternHandler.toWekaFormat()`,  follow the Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF), as
described in the [http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html Weka documentation]. What
follows is a description for the relation fields naming and types.

Each spike rate pattern relation have a corresponding neuron names set, `N`, and
a pattern window width, `w`. Each relation will have `(N*w)+ 1` attributes. For each
neuron named `n` in `N`, there are `w` numeric attributes named `n_i` (for every `i`
between `0` and `w-1`). The remaining attribute is the class attribute and it is named
`label`. This is a string attribute that is significant to the experiment in question.

Each instance of the relation follows the ARFF conventions.
